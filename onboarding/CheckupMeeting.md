~~We strongly believe happy people are the best ingredients for an happy team.~~

Wait, what? You're not a fu****g ingredient! You're a person !

And we really hope you're having a good time with us. 
Not because we're some kinds of philanthropists ‚Äî¬†but simply because otherwise, you won't make good stuff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is why we're sometimes having **Checkup Meetings** with team members (especially interns), to make sure reality meets our hopes. But :

- We tend to do these in an informal (that's cool) but sometimes unstructured (less cool) way, and sometimes forget some important questions (not cool at all)
- It's quite inevitably a stressful exercice that some would like to prepare

That's why :

- we are giving out this canvas to help both of us ask the rights question during the Checkup Meeting
- we are enforcing a schedule for these ‚Äî monthly the 6 first months of work with us, yearly afterwards. You'll always be warned at least 1 week in advance.
- we are insisting on the ability for anyone to call for a checkup meeting anytime, should you feel to need for it

This form is only here to facilitate the conversation.
Let's discuss frankly together and see what we can improve!
