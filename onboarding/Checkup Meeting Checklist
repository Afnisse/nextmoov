~~We strongly believe happy people are the best ingredients for an happy team.~~

Wait, what? You're not a fucking ingredient! You're a person !

And we really hope you're having a good time with us. 
Not because we're some kinds of philanthropists ‚Äî¬†but simply because otherwise, you won't make good stuff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We know 2 things :

- Time flies by fast around here
- Evaluation is a tough exercise for both people

That's why :

- We built this form to help both of us ask the rights question during the Checkup Meeting
- You'll have a monthly checkup the 6 first months of work with us, yearly afterwards
- You can ask to have a non-scheduled checkups any time.

This form is only here to facilitate the conversation.
Let's discuss frankly together and see what we can improve!

Ho, one last thing : there is one trap question... Will you spot it?
