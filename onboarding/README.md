# Welcome on board, {{firstName}} ðŸ˜‰

The nextmoov family is proud to announce the birth of their ~~child~~ teammate.
Congrats and welcome you (again)! ðŸŽ‰

Whether you join us for a few weeks or for longer term doesn't change much. \
In our eyes, you're now officially a member of the nextmoov family.

This small guide should give you a fair snapshot of your first days and weeks with us. 


## Once upon a time

Prior to giving you officially this handbook, we've probably met somewhere around a cup of coffee, flattered each other with superlatives, negotiated like pigs (hope you did that part well, 'coze it's too late now ðŸ˜‚) and finally signed a contract. 

But as said, this is most probably sorted out if you're holding this guide in your hands.


## The D-Day

So here we are. Day-1. You are sitting in front of a (still somewhat) stranger, reading this guide with excitement.  Hopefully you've been giving a cup of of coffee. If not, don't hesitate to ask for it out loud. Now.

This guide is part of the Welcome Pack you have received, along with a brand new notebook, a pile of business cards and a welcome card signed by the whole team. How sweet, isn't it?

You're in our office inside BeCentral, a friendly digital campus packed with other startups and coding school. You should definitely take some time to walk around and discover the place. 

But before you do so, we have a few last administrative burden to go through, namely:

## Monday blues

Uh, you're still there? Great news, that means you certainly start falling in love with your weird colleagues ðŸ™ƒ

This last section is a jumble of good-to-know about your daily life at nextmoov.


### Access to the office

BeCentral is accessible 24/7 but open to the public only from 9 to 5. Outside those working hours, you'll need a badge to enter the building. 

Anyway, our own office is also closed with a badge and we have only two of them in total so if you plan to come to work please ensure you either have one or you're joining a colleague who has one.


### Team agenda

Your @nextmoov.be address grants you access to a personal agenda AND a team agenda. Please use it to indicate any days-offs you're planning to take as well as your presence in the office.


### Office supplies (printer & meeting rooms)

There is a printer available in BeCentral but you'll need to set it up first. Good luck with that ðŸ˜‚([MAC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kg5jTT-Pz5srbGPgeAPQFDal2I9JnuqX) or [PC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pNxbQR1qy0eCY1qZZjbpXPFXjc-Z0zIu)).

Meeting rooms can also be [booked](https://becentral.yarooms.com/) (Credentials in 1Password).


### Professional expenses

All professional expenses are reimbursed upon completion of the following [template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-qUpyK7fsPh7t9UOrAo9WcPFKUxSjE_6) and providing the original invoices are attached to it.
