We're sometimes having Checkup Meetings with team members (especially interns).
But :

- We tend to do these in an informal (that's cool) but sometimes unstructured (less cool) way, and sometimes forget some important questions (not cool at all)
- It's quite inevitably a stressful exercice that some would like to prepare
- We sometimes forget to do these w/ more senior team members

To fix this, I'd like to introduce a new page on the main repository: 
- giving a canvas of questions for theses interview
- enforcing a schedule for these
- insisting on the ability for anyone to call for a checkup meeting anytime.

As with all stuff nextmoov, this canvas should be open & built all together :-)

Following is a first draft ("pi√®ce √† casser"), open for discussion :-) 
Can't wait to read your feedback <3

~~We strongly believe happy people are the best ingredients for an happy team.~~

Wait, what? You're not a fucking ingredient! You're a person !

And we really hope you're having a good time with us. 
Not because we're some kinds of philanthropists ‚Äî¬†but simply because otherwise, you won't make good stuff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We know 2 things :

- Time flies by fast around here
- Evaluation is a tough exercise for both people

That's why :

- We built this form to help both of us ask the rights question during the Checkup Meeting
- You'll have a monthly checkup the 6 first months of work with us, yearly afterwards
- You can ask to have a non-scheduled checkups any time.

This form is only here to facilitate the conversation.
Let's discuss frankly together and see what we can improve!

Ho, one last thing : there is one trap question... Will you spot it?
