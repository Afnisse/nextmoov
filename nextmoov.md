# We are nextmoov, and this is how we work

# What's this?

We're handing you this guide so you can familiarize yourself with the nextmoov mindset, our organization and all the little details that make us the best team ever. Before diving into practical information, let's go through what makes nextmoov awesome üí™üèº	


# Our DNA.


### We are in a quest to redefine work

We're trying to reinvent the way a team works together. And we mean it. We leave it to you to read all resulting principles below but _SPOILER_ alert: it involves working whenever and wherever you see fit and you might fall in love with it.

### We are rooted in the mobility of tomorrow 

You may already know that: our founders don't have their driving license, and nextmoov was built on top of NextRide. We use public transit and alternative transports every day, so the experience is as real as it can get. Our roots are in the mobility sector but our future lies in digital nomadism.


### Our projects must be meaningful, groundbreaking & outstanding

We can be quite picky when it comes to selecting the projects we jump in. \
Not so much because we are so popular we can afford to be so. But rather because we believe we work best when we are passionate about something and our clients are too.


# Our principles.


### Efficiency at the heart of our work

A lot of people judge their work by the quantity instead of the quality. We don't. We aim to work as smart as possible and be as efficient as possible. We hate losing time, in commute, in useless meetings, in endless boring 9-to-5 weekdays. \
Our goal: creating the most efficient team in the world.


### Rigorous methodology

We believe we can produce our best work, by working smarter (and actually less). But that ambitious goal comes at a cost: we all must follow the rules of a rigorous methodology. And we're rather uncompromising on those.


### We don't care how, but your work should be fantastic

We don't care _when_ you work. We don't care _where_ you work. We only care that the work is done perfectly and in time. That means no shift, no timesheet, no mandatory presence. If you want to work during the night, good for you! We're not all made the same. Your work just better be amazing, no matter what.


### Move your ass

Babysitting is not our thing. If you're in doubt, don't sit still wondering what you should do. We won't bite you (as far as I remember, it hasn't happened _yet_). Anyway, if you have a question, you should fire away. We'll reply as soon as we have a minute.


### Work on your own

We believe you make the best of your work when you concentrate (no shit!). That's why we work alone. No shoulder tap interruptions, but convenient collaboration (see Collaboration below).


### Plan together

But we also believe constructive criticism helps to shape betters products. We must show our work to others on a regular basis. At the very least during a weekly review, but not only. 


### Report often

We don't work in the same room, and we don't appreciate unplanned interruptions. That's why we must all continuously and automatically report progress on our part of the job.


### The 15 percent rule

Developing top-notch products is great but requires to stay ahead of the pack at all times. And that means taking the time to experiment, combine, tweak ... all the new cool things available out there. Hence we decided to allocate 15% of our work time to just that: have fun building what may turn out to be our next big thing.


### Conventions over configurations

We love stealing concepts from our developers to use them in our daily lives. \
One of our favorites: "conventions over configurations". Conventions everywhere calm down our OCD, but also help us save hours and hours of work.  \
Naming folders, picking a slack channel, writing a subject line: conventions help us automate all these hundreds of decisions we take everyday. \
Keeping everything nice and tidy ‚Äî¬†automagically!

Simplicity

Yet another rule we stole from our developers: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). \
We always aim to simplify things. But hey, take note of that one: quite often, the simplest solution is far from the easiest. The simplest solution might be to stop working with a client we don't have a match with, refuses complicated but well paying project, stop working with a team member who don't fit in.  \
Hard decisions, but simple one: they allow us to stay who we are.


### Use the best tool

As you will see in the Guidelines, we have strong conventions over what tools we use. Slack, BitBucket, Drive: all these tools are like the hammer of‚Ä¶ well, whatever profession uses a hammer. By using _creme de la creme _tools, we stop doing repetitive dumbass tasks and concentrate on what distinguishes us from stupid bots: building unique things.


### Openness

Freelancers have access to core data about the company. The only reason not to disclose documents are the ones that are of a legal type. Income? Turnover? Plans? We start by sharing everything with the team, instead of the other way round.


### Paperless

We are a digital agency. Like‚Ä¶ digital. We print almost nothing and keep everything in the cloud.

Let's build a better future. GO TREES! üå≥


### Come as you are

Unless we have a meeting with a partner or client, we really (like reaaaally) don't care how you're dressed. Leave mandatory suits to boring companies. And in the case of a meeting, you should still avoid suits but use a casual smart or casual business dress code.


### The Œ± and the Œ©

We build our products in an agile way, meaning we deliver regularly so as to ensure the perfect fit with our client's needs. That also means every release should build on top the previous and bring added value. Which in turns involves a lot (a lot ( a lot ( a lot))) of testing. As we're all in the same boat, we expect we all participate to it. So allow some free space to welcome Alpha and Beta apps in your busy phone. And use them.


# Collaborating.


### WeeklyBrief

Every Friday at 14.00, we meet all together and have a debriefing of the past Sprint. You will be reviewing your assigned Stories with your Project Manager, and according to the project progress, you will be briefed for the upcoming week.


### Constant reporting

Everyone should constantly report progress on the appropriate Airtable project base and push their code on Bitbucket. And the automatic integration to Slack will do the trick.


# Writing.


## General guidelines

First and foremost, nextmoov is written nextmoov. Forget "NextMoov", "Nextmoov", and don't even try "NextMove" or adding a space in the middle: the Creative Director might be slightly upset ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


### English only, but the customer is king

All internals documents should be written in English. But beware that documents made for clients should be written communication in the  language chosen by the client in the Client OnBoarding Process.

For internal communication, such as Slack or e-mails, feel free to speak French or English.


## Documents


### Use Google Drive

Unless you reaaaaally need THAT very specific function from Excel, always use Google Drive. Collaboration will be way more easier for everyone ‚Äî don't we all hate playing boomerang with Something-V29-ModifsThomas-ReluParMathieu-CheckFrancois-FINAL.docx by e-mail?


### Use styles

Structure your Google Docs documents using Title 1, Title 2, ... instead of manually picking font size. That will allow you to do things like changing all the titles all at once, or generate a nice index.


### Use templates

It's pretty self-explanatory. We hate losing time, so we simplify tasks. You can find some basic templates in your Drive.


## E-mails


### Follow our subject line convention

Following a simple convention when writing the subject line of an e-mail can help both the client and us save a lot of time when searching for a specific e-mail. It also helps us to build some automated reports.


```
nextmoov/<CLIENT_ID> - Project - Specific subject of e-mail
```


Example :


```
nextmoov/Cambio - Discover&Register - Payment
```



### Answer all e-mails in less than 24 hours

If you need more than 24 hours to answer an e-mail, you must let the client know by sending a quick e-mail saying so. Being available to our clients is a cornerstone of our reputation.


### Follow-up with the client if she doesn't answer e-mail

If you sent an e-mail between Monday and Wednesday, send a friendly reminder on Monday. If you sent an e-mail between Tuesday and Sunday, send a friendly reminder on Wednesday.

You must avoid sending "complex" e-mails on Friday after 11.00AM.** **And last but not least, you must use our corporate signature.


### Systematically cc the appropriate Slack channel

We've been through this already, Slack is our all-in-one communication hub and you should therefore cc the channel e-mail address so we make sure everyone has access to the freshest information at all time.


# Tools.


### Our all-rounders' daily companions

You know the best teams out there all have their legendary tools, right? Think of Frodo's ring, Harry's wand or Superman's underwear üí•

Likewise, at nextmoov, we have some wonderful tools to fuel our collaboration. Proudly introducing you to the ASD1-squad: Airtable, Slack, Google Drive, 1Password.

Airtable is a shared database where we store everything from contacts details to inventory of assets. It is also our primary project management tool and the place where you'll find our main [coding and writing conventions](https://airtable.com/shr6JG46neKj6wx1V).

Slack is our all-in-one internal communication tool. This is the place where the teamwork happens, from sharing news to raising questions to your colleagues. Its power comes from its tight integration with all our other tools (Airtable, Drive, Mail, Bitbucket ‚Ä¶) making it the perfect hub to stay up-to-date. Also, this is where we make jokes most of the time :)

Next comes Google Drive, our... well you know Drive right?

Lastly, for the accounts we share among the agency, we use 1Password, our cloudy safe. 

And that's it.

‚Ä¶ Wait, what about the good ol' mail then? Well, we use it of course, but for external communication only and with some strict writing conventions (see below).

Before going any further, we should tell you that we're a macOS-oriented agency. This means all our tools run on macOS. Depending on your profile, it might affect you differently (have you ever tried opening a _.key_ file on your windows laptop? ü§™).


### For developers

We made it clear already: we want to use the best tools only along with some strong coding conventions to smooth our collaboration.

As of today (20181224 üéÑ), here is a list of the MUST and SHOULD tools we use:



*   All our private codebases are stored in Bitbucket so you'll definitely get your own access to it. As soon as the first line of code is written, all our projects must use Git and they must be pushed to BitBucket. They must be pushed at least every Friday at 13:00 as the full completion of tasks assigned to that week for you will only be judged upon code pushed online.
*   Our infrastructure runs on Docker + Rancher + Drone + Sentry + Traefik and is hosted on servers provided by DigitalOcean.  \
[If you want to learn more about it.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gSAxu_PtrcKic1PAhEltk6zUNjKFZ49bMxTeOvfcIWk/edit)
*   We warmly recommend you Atom or VSCode as IDEs and, in any case, find a way to lint your code according to our standards (see next).
*   We use the Uneo bootstrap as template for our websites.

Code-wise, you should use UNIX line breaks and two-spaces indent, and you should use our preset configurations for IDEs. All our repositories must follow [Conventional Commits](http://conventionalcommits.org/) inspired by [AngularJS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/preview).


### For designers

Well there's nothing as fancy as secret keys and stuff for you. But you're part of the best team in nextmoov üëë ‚Äî disclaimer: parts of this guide were written by the Creative Director. With Sketch App, you should be all set. And that's it. Photoshop is also accepted, but discouraged for UI design.

Other design tools such as Framer X are still being considered but haven't been thoroughly tested yet.

It seems logical, but we remind you that as a freelance designer, you should own your own legal copies of the softwares you use.

# Teammate onboarding.

The nextmoov family is proud to announce the birth of their ~~child~~ teammate. Congrats and welcome you (again)! üéâ

Whether you join us for a few weeks or for longer term doesn't change much. \
In our eyes, you're now officially a member of the nextmoov family.

This small guide should give you a fair snapshot of your first days and weeks with us. 


## Once upon a time

Prior to giving you officially this handbook, we've probably met somewhere around a cup of coffee, flattered each other with superlatives, negotiated like pigs (hope you did that part well, 'coze it's too late now üòÇ) and finally signed a contract. 

But as said, this is most probably sorted out if you're holding this guide in your hands.


## The D-Day

So here we are. Day-1. You are sitting in front of a (still somewhat) stranger, reading this guide with excitement.  Hopefully you've been giving a cup of of coffee. If not, don't hesitate to ask for it out loud. Now.

This guide is part of the Welcome Pack you have received, along with a brand new notebook, a pile of business cards and a welcome card signed by the whole team. How sweet, isn't it?

You're in our office inside BeCentral, a friendly digital campus packed with other startups and coding school. You should definitely take some time to walk around and discover the place. 

But before you do so, we have a few last administrative burden to go through, namely:



*   Signing the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that protects our dear intellectual property
*   Granting you accesses to your G Suite account ‚Äî your very own @[nextmoov.be](http://nextmoov.be) address and access to Gmail, Drive, agenda and all SSO-compatible apps.
*   Walking you around Slack, our internal communication hub (and setting a shiny new profile pic!)
*   Posting your lovely face on our Social Media accounts : (Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin. Not TikTok, yet).
*   Configuring your e-mail signature using the following template:

  
    
```
<style>.lh14 {line-height: 1.4;}</style><div style="font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; background-color: white; font-weight: 400; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;"><br><br><br><div style="margin-left: 1px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/nextmoov-website%2Fd816959a-2be3-45ab-b77a-11ff0f5c52d8_logo.png" alt="nextmoov" height="16px"></div><div style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 2px;">Name Surname</div><div style="color: #FF3F6F; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 600;">Function </div><div class="lh14" style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.4;"><a href="tel:+32479742328" value="+32479742328" target="_blank" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">Phone Number</a><br><a href="tel:+3225880306" value="+3225880306" target="_blank" style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">+32 2 588 03 06</a><br><a href="https://nextmoov.be" target="_blank" style="color: #FF3F6F; text-decoration: none;">nextmoov.be</a></div><div style="color: #FF3F6F; font-size: 10px; margin-top: 18px;"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase;">Smart Digital Studio</span></div></div>
```



If you have received all the above you're good to go! The owner of the project(s) you're contributing to will now brief you and ensure you hop on smoothly. 

Enjoy ‚úä 


## Monday blues

Uh, you're still there? Great news, that means you certainly start falling in love with your weird colleagues üôÉ

This last section is a jumble of good-to-know about your daily life at nextmoov.


### Access to the office

BeCentral is accessible 24/7 but open to the public only from 9 to 5. Outside those working hours, you'll need a badge to enter the building. 

Anyway, our own office is also closed with a badge and we have only two of them in total so if you plan to come to work please ensure you either have one or you're joining a colleague who has one.


### Team agenda

Your @nextmoov.be address grants you access to a personal agenda AND a team agenda. Please use it to indicate any days-offs you're planning to take as well as your presence in the office.


### Office supplies (printer & meeting rooms)

There is a printer available in BeCentral but you'll need to set it up first. Good luck with that üòÇ([MAC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kg5jTT-Pz5srbGPgeAPQFDal2I9JnuqX) or [PC](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pNxbQR1qy0eCY1qZZjbpXPFXjc-Z0zIu)).

Meeting rooms can also be [booked](https://becentral.yarooms.com/) (thomas@nextmoov.be ‚Äî HWy-qAx-NDK-b3A).


### Professional expenses

All professional expenses are reimbursed upon completion of the following [template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-qUpyK7fsPh7t9UOrAo9WcPFKUxSjE_6) and providing the original invoices are attached to it.
