iOS iTunes Connect
To test <APP>, please follow this procedure on your iOS device:
- Open your Apple TestFlight invitation in your mail inbox
- Tap the “View in TestFlight” button
- If you have TestFlight installed on your device, skip this step. If you do not have TestFlight yet installed on your device, follow the instructions provided by Apple
- Install the beta build through TestFlight, just like you would do in the App Store.
Please note that iOS only allows one same app to be installed at once. Thus, you cannot have the public release installed along with the beta build. Installing the beta will simply replace your App Store. When the test ends, make sure to install the App Store version again, since builds expire after some extended period of time.
