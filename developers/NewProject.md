# New Project Checklist

## Architecture
Your project should be divided in multiple separated components: 

- one or multiple API
- a web-client
- A mobile application

Start by taking a moment to think how you will divide your project. 
The point should be to maximum code-reuse across multiple projects for a client.

## Setup Walkthrough (TODO)


### Slack
1. If this is the first project for this client, create a channel named “r-<CLIENT>” 
“CLIENT” must be rigorously the same as the one used in AirTable
2. Create a channel name “p-<PROJECT>”
“PROJECT” must be rigorously the same as the one used in AirTable

### GitHub
[Create project in GitHub](https://github.com/new)
Create a repository for every component of your project :
[Create project in GitHub](https://github.com/new)

### GitHub + Slack Integration
Add a new configuration to the BitBucket integration in Slack
It should post to r-<CLIENT> channel created earlier.
