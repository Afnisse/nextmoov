# Projects 

We feel like any team member should be able to describe what we're working on — even drunk at 3 am somewhere in a music festival.

Of course, [nextmoov.be](https://nextmoov.be) is the best place to get some nice visuals of our lovely projects. \
This list is here to help you put a few buzzwords on top of these.

_Sorted by alphabetical order_

### Aware

The PEREX center for sustainable mobility.
Display all disruptions of public transport in Belgium (TEC, STIB, De Lijn and SNCB).
Interactive TV maps integration for a big media client in Belgium (Keywall for RTBF).

### Cambio

The carsharing leader in Belgium. You take one car in any of the 500 stations, drive wherever you want, and bring it back.
We built their app for the registration process, Start2Cambio.
It allows to pay directly in the app using Bancontact, and use your identity card to speed up the process.

### Ecolo

The green political party of Belgium.

We designed a few specific pages of their website : candidates, program, Ecolo nearby you.
We also built the first chatbot of a belgian political party with them, she's called Cléo.

### MobiScore.io

Like Nutriscore, but for Mobility \
A project by Stoomlink.

One letter (from A to E) that gives you an idea of how well a specific address in Belgium is accessible only by using public transport.

### Modalizy

A credit-card that reinvents Mobility.

We built their app : it allows to see any mobility solutions nearby (bus stops, charging stations, shared bikes,...) 
as well as to buy a train ticket or a bus ticket directly in the app, in less than 30 seconds.

### Smart Mobility Planner

Our project with the 4 belgian public transport operators : TEC, STIB-MIVB, NMBS-SNCB and De Lijn. \
Paid for by the Belgian Government.

The first real-time & intermodal route planner in Belgium.
You can make a trip from Arlon to Oostend and have realtime on every part of your trip.

The frontend is a proof of concept, this idea is to replace (some) of the 4 engines behind the websites and apps of the public transport operators.

### Stoomlink

Insighful Mobility. \
Our joint-venture with [Stratec](http://www.stratec.be/news/adresse-belge-dispose-desormais-de-mobiscore/) and [VIAS](https://www.vias.be/).\
Stoomlink fosters innovative digital projects around (Smart) Mobility.
