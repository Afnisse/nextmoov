# For Product & Project Managers

Building great products is fun.\
Doing it in a timely and efficient way is just **an absolute requirements**.

And again, we believe that strong conventions enforced by powerfull tools makes it just easier for everyone (you know the trick, right?).

## Our Product Development Lifecycle

You won't be surprise if we'd tell you that nextmoov is an **agile-centric development company**. After all, who on earth would claim the opposite these days? And just as everyone else do, we take most of our inspiration from Design Thinking, Lean Startup and Scrum, all-at-once.

But not just because *everyone else does it*. 

We do it because we believe that a tight collaboration between our clients and developement teams along the product development lifecycle is key to delivering successfull products. And here is how it looks in practice:
